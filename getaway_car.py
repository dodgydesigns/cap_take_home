"""
In mathematics, the Pythagorean theorem or Pythagoras' theorem is a fundamental
relation in Euclidean geometry between the three sides of a right triangle. It
states that the area of the square whose side is the hypotenuse (the side opposite
the right angle) is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares on the other two sides.
The theorem can be written as an equation relating the lengths of the sides a, b and
the hypotenuse c, sometimes called the Pythagorean equation.

    the corresponding timestamp. Given this list of points and timestamps,
