Welcome to Graeme Muller's solutions repo for the fun tasks provided by Andrew of Capgemini to test Graeme's extensive knowledge and ability.

This repo contains a number of groovy projects that do require some dependencies. To get things ready to see some astounding programs, please follow the instructions below.

Enjoy.

To run these classes, I suggest you create a virtual environment using virtualenv.
1. Install virtualenv (pip install virtualenv)
2. cd to the cap_take_home folder and run: virtualenv .venv
3. Type: source .venv/bin/activate
4. Type: pip install -r requirements.txt

This will install all the required dependencies for the projects to run.
