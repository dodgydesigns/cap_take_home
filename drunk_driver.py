trigonometry, the branch of mathematics concerned with specific
functions of angles and their application to calculations. There
are six functions of an angle commonly used in trigonometry.
Their names and abbreviations are sine (sin), cosine (cos),
tangent (tan), cotangent (cot), secant (sec), and cosecant (csc).
