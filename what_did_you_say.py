"""
In information theory and computer science, the Levenshtein distance is a
string metric for measuring the difference between two sequences. Informally,
the Levenshtein distance between two words is the minimum number of
single-character edits (i.e. insertions, deletions or substitutions)
required to change one word into the other.
